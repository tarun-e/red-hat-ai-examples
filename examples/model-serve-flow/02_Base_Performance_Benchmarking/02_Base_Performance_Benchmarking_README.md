## Performance Benchmarking

Use GuideLLM to run performance benchmarking on the base model. The results from benchmarking the base and compressed models are later compared in [Step 6: Comparison](../06_Comparison/Performance_Comparison.md).

### Prerequisites

- A base model (RedHatAI/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) has been downloaded and saved in `model-serve-flow/base_model/` folder.

### Procedure

1. ```text
        cd ../02_Base_Performance_Benchmarking

2. Open the [Base_Performance_Benchmarking.ipynb](Base_Performance_Benchmarking.ipynb) file in JupyterLab and follow the instructions directly in the notebook. This will give results for the base model.

### Verification

- A vLLM server hosting the base model has started
- Performance metrics have been saved in the `model-serve-flow/results/` folder

## Next step

Proceed to [Step 3: Model Compression](../03_Model_Compression/03_Model_Compression_README.md).
