# Red Hat AI Examples

This repository provides example notebooks and flows to help users get started with AI and machine learning on Red Hat
platforms. It is supported by a library of tools that can be packaged to simplify usage and accelerate development.

## Features

### Welcome to Red Hat OpenShift AI Examples

This repository provides a curated collection of runnable, well-documented Jupyter notebooks, pipelines, and code
samples. These resources are designed to demonstrate how to effectively build, customize, evaluate, deploy, and
manage Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models and applications on Red Hat AI. The focus
is on practical application and learning, enabling users to explore the full potential of AI for meaningful customer
use cases.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Explore the `examples/` directory for examples for different usecase.
3. Use the `ai-tools` library to for helper/utility functions required for the examples.
    Build the wheel for th `ai-tools` library using the following command:

    ```sh
    uv build
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in each example's `README.md` for setup and execution.
